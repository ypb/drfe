Random thoughts while using actually doing "something" useful v0.1.0:

 * implement "null" say/ask behaviour:
   - say "knows" what to search for but perhaps ask could, too, without disturbing the first...
   - hmmm... a sort of staging area?!?
   - fsm?
 * extricate "drfe command switch" -> the problem of language and syntemantics

 * "relative" time formatting
 * reverse order of the printout with "tot" topwise and "now" at the bottom, always!
 * temporal events (i.e. basic start/stop) and time "overlays" (morning as a start of "a day")

 * creating .drfe dir in cwd is "cute" but DO tie it into some "root" place...
   cwd could "spatially" determine temporal priority of events having been said "here"
   even though they happened before "root" events or events in order places...

 * single worded "says" are queer e.g. URL without at least single tag is not so meaningful

 * implement revert/editing... of the past or at least immediate oopses ;}

DETAILS:

 * in "reaction": do not print duplicate events, silly boy...
 * in "ask": do not print atomic query event
 * ponder duplicate events... ask doesn't modify content but "some weights of order"...
   it "bubbles" events up to the front in the linked-list chain...
 * a kind of spacio-temporal vocabulary say/voice ask/tabulate tell/narly ;-p

DUMB:

 * lol, but that "utf-8 strings" are guaranteed to not contain 0xFe, doesn't mean ukey can't,
   so it looks like using it as delimiter in blobs of ukeys is completely dumb idea, meh
