The idea of Yiaesh is born in the form of README file. Tossing initial
prototype of GTD scheme in the form of shell script trying to use tdbtool.
Spent last two days re-pondering what and how I want to achieve and I think
I have an initial shape of implementation of the "historical snippets
database" in my head. Now, C, baby, hawabanga, dude! Segment<carrier> lost.

Looks like it's going to take loonger than my meager C skills envisioned it
to me ;-} Basic init, eventcount, etc is in place and at the point of making
ready to add atomos. At ~300 LOC I think it's ready for an initial commit, heh.
We can fork it then into basic non-atomized events adding abstraction of "axis"
access, versioning DB and the like. But first there is a need to describe
what/how/why I want to implement lest it slips my mind and messy paper notes,
again. As it is, now, main() simply passes everything to say(), so it should
be easy to insert it into esh at any time, but while it's still not working it
may as well remain an individial executable and a sort of poligon for further
development. Calling it dereferencier (or simply DrFe) in the spirit of GTD and
"snippets" application.
